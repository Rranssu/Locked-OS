A locked OS from a a CD collection in which I bought in a thrift shop in japan. One contents of the CD is this specific folder with the operating system MX TOS.
The said OS has the version 10.03. which was released around late 80's. The OS is locked and I have no particular knowledge in TOS, but I did manage to port this one 
for it to be able to run on modern hardware. Still it remains Locked. I uploaded this here hoping you guys code solve it.
